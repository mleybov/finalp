<h1>Why is QA important?</h1>
<br>QA is important because users like products that work. If a product is released and there are a lot of bugs in it, then no one is happy. The user is not happy and the engineers who made the product are not happy. It becomes a lose-lose situation. The last process of developing software is testing the software to make sure it works.

The last part of the SDLC (systems development life cycle, a term used in systems engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system) before the product is released is software testing. If not for this type of testing many terrible things can happen. For example, on June 4, 1996 an unmanned Ariane 5 rocket launched by the European Space Agency exploded just forty seconds after its lift-off from Kourou, French Guiana. “It turned out that the cause of the failure was a software error in the inertial reference system. Specifically a 64 bit floating point number relating to the horizontal velocity of the rocket with respect to the platform was converted to a 16 bit signed integer. The number was larger than 32,767, the largest integer storable in a 16 bit signed integer, and thus the conversion failed.”1

If there is a bug in an imporatnt piece of technology in the medical field, for example, then people can lose their lives. This is where QA, software testers, come in and make sure that the specs are clear and that there are no bugs that could potentially harm us.</p>
